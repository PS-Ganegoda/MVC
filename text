                MVC
----------------------------------------

* mvc stands for model,view,controller
* view mean the interface of frontends

*  controller is controll the bothodel   snd view 
   that means controller is made connection between view and model
   controller is a brain of the project
    it coded by php


* model means database
  it is creating qury of databasechecking the results in model

* why mvc?
  it is very convinient
  it makes your project update much easier

* Router
  router need to clean up the url by using router

  we need router to tell the controller what pages to load 

  router is a package of the url s that the controller can understand

  -----just move to the architecture----

  * Core folder is applications itselfs

   yourwebsite/assets    so this'/' is navigate for another folder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   when we called some folder without assign function or file it is automativally redirect to the index.php file (if this folder have )




   ----------------------------OOP CONCEPTS---------------------------------------------------
   * this is the  main wya ti create fubctions in index.php
        <?php
             class myclass{
             function myfunc()
             {

             }
            function myfunc2()
              {

                }
             
        ?>
             }

    class is a blue print of the the designing the objects  

    so then create a object we can used 
            $variable = new Classname()   

 * if not any html file dont put  the closing php tag in the project

          function __constructor{

          }
    this is an special function that called the class itself.constructor is automstically run when the variable function is called imediately.

    ----------------------------creating Router------------------------------------------

    the GET variable is get the urls the get variables gets all vlues
    after the question marks.

    localhost/udemy/public/index.php?a=1;  =======> Array([a]=>1)

    localhost/udemy/public/index.php?a=1&b=8&c=9;  =======> Array([a]=>1[b]=>8[c]=>9)

-------------------HTACCESS FILE-----------------

 used to manupulate apache 

        -                                                                                                   |                                                                                                  |       RewriteEngine On
        |     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
        |    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
        |    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [L,QSA]
        |
  RewriteEngine On means the apache engin on we can rewrite conditions and rules

  'RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d' means if the file name in the url it should load the if if the directory then load it.


   then the rule RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [L,QSA] means the beggining to the end any thing that in the query string pushed to the index.php , if not invalied create url and put the all things.
